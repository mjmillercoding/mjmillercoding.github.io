            Top 5 movies.
        </h2>
        <p><b>Prefece:</b>I don't think i could distinguish between my top 5 movies, beacuase I enjoy a movie based on well done aspects of a movie.</p>

        <p><b>The Thing:</b> I enjoy this movie, I think the real distinguishing factor in this movie is how they are able to build an atmosphere with music and the lack of effects.</p>
        <p><b>Wolf of Wallstreet:</b> I think that there are a lot of good aspects to this movie. The acting in this movie is a great movie. There are also lot of themes about how money changes peoples morals.</p>
        <p><b>Akira:</b> What really shines in this movie is the art, and the lengths that the animators went through to create an amazing animation. This movie truely caps off the era of hand drawn animation.</p>
        <p><b>Fight Club:</b> I really enjoy this movie. The late movie twist is setup in such a way that before you know about it, things will happen and it will make sense from your prospective. However, the truth of the events is farcry from how it is originally precieved, and on a second watch it is almost like a new movie.</p>
        <p><b>2001: A Space Odyssey:</b> Any person you ask will say that this movie was visually stunning, and they would be right. On top of being extremely well shot and produced, this movie touches on still new ideas, such as, artifical intelligence going insane, and forced evolution.</p>
