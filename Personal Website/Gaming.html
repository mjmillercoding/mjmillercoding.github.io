            <img src="images/PC.jpg" alt="Gaming PC"> <br>A subjective tier list of games I've played!
        </h1>

        <h2>S Tier</h2> A game that has great concepts that are played out to the fullest potential.
        <p><b>Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2:</b> This game is great because you can see your actions afecting various parts of your stories.</p>
        <p><b>Escape from Tarkov:</b> I love this game. It is an ultra realistic multiplayer shooter, where everything you use can be lost. The goal of the game is to survive raids in location while getting loot.</p>
        <p><b>The Talos Principle:</b> This game is a must play. If you have ever played the game portal, this game has the same elements that made that game a good puzzle game. On top of that it has a great story that has themes of in-doctrination and morality.</p>

        <h2>A Tier</h2> Games that have great concepts but are not as captivating due to either lack of key factors, such as story.
        <p><b>The Dark Souls Trilogy:</b> This is a great series to play if you enjoy really tough challenges for the euphoria that comes with completing the challenge.</p>
        <p><b>Portal:</b> This is a classic 3D puzzle game that uses the portal gun tool as a basis for all of the puzzles.</p>
        <p><b>Kenshi:</b> This is a very interessting game. It is a 3rd person RPG that has no real main character. You can pretty much do anything in the game that you want, and any characters you recruit play exactly the same fundementally as your first character.</p>

        <h2>B Tier</h2> Games that are fairly good, however, I probably wouldn't replay.
        <p><b>Super Mario 64:</b> This is a good game for its time but its not one I would play if not for nostalgia</p>
        <p><b>Trials Evolution and Fusion</b> These are challenging 2.5D games where the slightest mistake can ruin a run.</p>
        <p><b>Call of Duty Black Ops 2:</b> Probably the best COD game in terms of multiplayer.</p>
